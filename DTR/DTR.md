Project Expectations: What does each group member hope to get out of this project?

We both hope to have a successful and equitable pairing experience where we both contribute to the best of our abilities and learn many things about computer programming and successful collaboration.

Goals and expectations:

Goal 1: Project done by Tuesday night.
Goal 2: Work together in person as much as possible, acknowleding not being able to meet or work on Saturday
Goal 3: if possible meeting in person Sunday afternoon.  If not possible, being available on slack Sunday evening to screen share.
Goal 4: Use pomodoro timer to keep track of Github commits. Pushing commit every 30 minutes, and then switching computers if working simultaneously.
Goal 5: Finish encryption by Sunday night
Goal 6: Establish pairing with upper mod for Monday morning or afternoon
Goal 7: Finish Decryption by Monday night
Goal 8: Let each other know via slack whenever we are working on the project and what component

Team strengths:

Good communication and goal-setting. Strong desire to succeed.

How to overcome obstacles:

If benchmarks are not met due to difficulty grasping the content, we will reach out to upper mods/classmates/instructors the very next day.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually?):

We will meet at 8 am on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. We may meet in person Sunday.  We may stay up to an hour after school Monday, Tuesday, but will be available on slack later in the evenings.

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open?):

see goals

Abilities Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):

We're both new at this so we just expect each other to try our hardest and when we figure something out we both explain to the other any breakthroughs that we had.  By the end of the project we both want to be able to each create this project individually in the future without anyone else's help.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

We each will work on all components but will keep each other up to date via slack and github on what we have worked on and are working on.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests):

GitHub pushes every 30 minutes. Make sure we're each creating branches and reviewing pull requests.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

Be polite. Explain new things you've learned.  Be willing to say when you don't understand what is happening in a specific part of the code.

Agenda to discuss project launch:

See benchmark goals

Ideas:

Start with pseudocode always! Push gists of pseudocode to repo.

Tools: Slack, atom, terminal.
